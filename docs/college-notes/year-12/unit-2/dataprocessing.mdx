## Data Processing

When processing data there are three main types of processing used.

<Tabs>
<TabsItem value="batch" label="Batch" default>
Batch this is when you have a collection of data such as monthly statements utility bills or even power payroll and the data is being handled and processed in batches.
</TabsItem>

<TabsItem value="interactive" label="Interactive (transaction)" default>
Interactive (transaction) is transactions such as a hotel or a flight or bookings where the user interacts with the system this could also include such as things as 
ecommerce invoices these are often processed as they occur. 
</TabsItem>

<TabsItem value="real-time" label="Real-Time" default>
Real-time is a events that deal with as they occur on a system. This would include such things as Computer games, Cars ECU (Engine Control Unit).

### The Role of Hardware in Collecting Data 
At a basic level, hardware can be used for data collection simply through the provision of a keyboard on which to enter data. 

If we abstract this, it is the process of data 'entry' via a piece of hardware.  

In addition to a standard data entry scenario such as, typing in data, the following are other common methods of data collection: 

| Type of Hardware | Explanation |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Keyboard | The Keyboard analyzes and determines what characters to send to the computer. It maintains these characters in its memorybuffer (register or memory data register) and then send the data. For example, when typing paper-information it must be typed up manually to store the data electronically. |
| Optical Methods | Optical methods such as camera identify items, objects or people and this data can be stored automatically. For example, most phones use face ID to unlock the phone. First, the phone input the face to the CPU so it can process, and the if the face is verified the output would be the unlock of the phone. |
| Accelerometers | Accelerometers are wearable devices that measure accelerations of the body segment to which the monitor is attached. For example, accelerometers can be used to game controls such as movements |
| Wearables | Wearables are electronic devices that are physically worn by individuals in order to track, analyse and transmit personal data. For example, Smart watches can analyse the heartbeat and then calculate the heartbeat per minute and then send to the user its heart beat |
| Sensor | Sensor captures information relevant to a particular task, so the data can be used to make process improvements for the purpose of saving money or increasing efficiency. For example, temperature sensor detects temperature changes and convert these variations into data. |
| Touchscreen | Touchscreen capture information when the screen is touch by someone. For example, phones are touchscreen and this make easy to interact and it is more faster. The pressure when the screen is being touched, send a signal to the CPU which will convert to a action or display anything on the screen. |

### The Role of Software in Collecting Data 

The role of software would change when collecting data dependent on the data that is being collected or stored. 

Data collection is often stored within either a spreadsheet or a database which would be designed in developed

<Tabs>
<TabsItem value="reporting" label="Reporting" default>
Reporting follows on from the other data processing functions. This is where the findings from the analysis will be review the data and make decision based on the outcome. It will also identify any issues that may have been may have risen during the process. 
</TabsItem>

<TabsItem value="sorting" label="Sorting" default>
Sorting data is a function that it normally carried out one the data has been collated. Sorting data can allow you to look for trends, such as the most watched program on Netflix. 
It can enable to organised data in a particular order and even filter out redundant data. 
Sorting data can also be sorted into meaningful categories so that results can be quickly and effectively identified. 
</TabsItem>

<TabsItem value="validation" label="Validation" default>
Validation is used when setting up any system that requires data processing. 

It is used to ensure invalid data is rejected when importing data into a system. 
Through the design process eagle identify the different data types, the format of the data and any specific rules the data needs to follow.
