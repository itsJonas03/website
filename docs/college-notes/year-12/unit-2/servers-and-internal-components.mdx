## Typology of Servers

A server is a powerful computer that manages access to different resources and services over a network. 
Other devices connect to the server using methods such as Ethernet cables and WiFi. These computers ca then access the resources and services via the server they are connected to.

Different types of server commonly used are:

+ **Domain Server** – this controls the overall running of a network
+ **Web Servers** – host web pages and associated files, providing access to them over a network.
+ **Mail Server** – send and receives emails over a network. <br /> &nbsp; Types of protocol in Mail server:
    + SMTP
    + POP3
+ **File Servers** – stores and manages access to files and folders over a network.
+ **Print Server** – provides and manages access to prints over a network.

## Server - Internal Components

The internal components of a server are very similar to PC. Server CPU's will generally have more cache memory available. It's also possible for server CPU's to have many more cores than desktop CPU's.

**Memory** - Memory used in servers will still be DDR RAM, much like a desktop, however, it will be more likely to also be ECC (error-correcting code) RAM. This is designed to correct errors that might appear in volatile memory which is usually much more important in servers as they handle a lot of  important data than in PCs.

**Storage** - Hard disk drives are still more common than solid-state drives due to the need for large amounts of storage (though an SSD may be used for things for like boot drives). The HDD you will use with a server will usually be different to that of a desktop though.

**HDD** - have moving parts which makes them vibrate. Servers may have stacks of hard disk drives as they often have huge storage requirements. This can lead to a huge amount of vibration that will cause the moving parts inside the HDDs to damage. So server HDDs have additional protection from this vibration.

:::note
Servers will also rarely have graphics cards or even an integrated GPU in the motherboard as servers are not usually used for graphically intensive tasks.

Server internal components will be more expensive for similar speeds or capacity but have greater quality checks, better error prevention & greater energy efficiency overall.

### What is Cache?

A cache is a special storage for temporary files that makes a device to run faster and more efficiently.

### Why is it important to empty your cache?

It is important to clear your browser cache because prevents using old form and protect your private information and helps the applications to run faster.

### Why would a server need more cache than an average PC?

More cache means more data and instruction can be stored temporarily for quicker access.
