## Mobile Device - Internal Components

A mobile device internal components (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, etc.) are built into a single integrated circuit. 
This is known as "**System-on-a-Chip**" or "SoC". As components on a "System-on-a-Chip" (also known as a microcontroller) 
are built directly into the chip they are not replaceable, so upgrading individual components is not possible. 

SOC is the packaging of all necessary electronic circuit and parts for a 'system' (such as a handheld gaming device) onto a single integrated circuit or microchip.

Greater system reliability as less connections to be damaged by constant movement (due to reduced number of components on a PCB).

A lot of the internal components of a mobile device are specifically designed for saving space & reducing power consumption. 
The main memory uses LPDDR RAM, which uses less power than traditional DDR RAM. They also use Flash Memory for storage for similar reason.

LPDDR (Low-Power Double Data Rate) RAM is used on phone because it consumes very low power and produces less heat which is the contrast of 
a DDR RAM that is used on PC because consume more power and produces more heat

:::info
Despite being on a single chip SoC has cores that are independent of each other, so only need to be turned on when needed. 
Whereas a traditional processor would be turned on all the time which reduces the power consumption ad heat production.

A complex SoC may include the on-chip integration of the CPU and a GPU with various other hardware components.
Performance of SoC is usually inferior to desktop/traditional CPU architecture Because of this games may not be able to have the same level of referment/sophistication as a game on platform that uses desktop architecture. 
Games that are not optimized for this architecture may 'lag' and provide very poor user experience.

:::note
No need for additional cooling, which would allow the developers to include additional features in the device while 
also keeping the overall size of the case and weight of the device down.

:::info
Many new SoC have a core that is dedicated to power management which control process, etc. 
To maximize battery life which is important for a handheld device. SoC system usually require less power to run them.

Software can be embedded on the chip reducing the need for additional storage/reducing demand on lower memory size of mobile devices. 
However firmware, etc. Is more difficult to update which can be problematic if security issues are found, etc.

Easy to embed modern protocol on the chip as no need to communicate over additional busses, etc., 
with additional hardware as all components can be integrated and use the same instruction set.

## Multifunctional Device and their uses

A multifunctional device, also known as an MFD, and is one that is capable of performing more than one specific function.
We also often refer to these as multifunctional peripherals.

### Digital camera

A digital Camera is a device that is capable of taking photo and video and recording it as digital data.

### Printer

Multifunctional printers often combine several functions, such as printing, scanning, faxing and photocopying.
