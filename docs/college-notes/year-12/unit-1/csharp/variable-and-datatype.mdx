## Variable

Variable is a container that acts like a basket. Basically, it holds information in memory (RAM) such as a number.

The data can be taken in and out of the vairable in the same way you place an apple in and out of a basket.

The variable is used to store data in a program until it is needed.

> Anything enetered via keyboard (input) has to be stored into a variable.
>   Before a variable can be used to store data, it must be declared (created).
>
> This means that a location in the RAM must be created with the correct amount of space, 
> but as RAM has a complicated memory addres using numbers a simple identifier is used.
>
> So each variables uses an English word that is meaningful to the data. 
>> The variables identify is a reference to the real address space in memory.

## Constants

Constants are a way of storing a value that will not be changed. Constants aren't variables and therefore may not be modified.

Constants can be used stoore all the different datatypes this included numbers, boolean and strings.

:::tip
Don't create a constant to represent information that you expect to change at any time.
:::

Example:

``` Const Double pie = 3.142; ```

## Differences between C# and Python

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cSharp" label="C#" default>

C# requires you to declare the variable and then use it.

```cs
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(){

    String name = "";
    name = "John";

    // You can declare and assign a value at the same time
    name = "John";
    }
}
```      
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="codeblock" label="Python">
      Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
name = "John"
```
    
:::note
String is used for C# but not for python. String is called a data type. In Python it selects the one it thinks you need.
:::


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Datatype 

The data type says how much memory will be allocated to that variable.

:::info
Some languages such as python do not need you to include a data tye when declaring a variable. 
:::

Datatype will tell the computer what type of data the variable can store and how to handle the data.

:::note
Datatypes are important because it will ensure that enough space has been given to the value
the variable will hold otherwise the program would crash with a memory overflow problem
