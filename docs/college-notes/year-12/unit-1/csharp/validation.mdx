## Validation

Validation is the process that attempets to prevent nonsensical inputs.

The term "**Constraints**" are often used to describe limiting factors which be used to validate user inputs.

```Try/catch``` is one example of constraint to limit the input. Other types of validation do not use special functions (blocks of code are designed to do a particular job).

:::note 

It is **important** to build in validation rules into a solution as it will check whether the inputs are
sensible and prevents inaccurate results, run-time errors or fatal crashes.

:::

When error occur a post action check will direct the user what to do or what mistake that
they have made.

```cs
public static void Main(){
    try{ //try these lines of code
        Console.WriteLine("...");

    }
    catch(exception e){ //catch any exception
        Console.WriteLine("please enter a number");
    }
}
```
