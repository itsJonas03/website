## Structure

Before going into C# programming, we should look at the minimum structure C# programm.

``` cs
using System;
namespace Program {
    class Program {
        static void Main (string[] args) {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

When this code is compiled and executed, it will display ```Hello World"!```.

:::note
- C# is case sensitive !
- All the statement/declaration must end with a semicolon (;).
- The program execution starts at the Main method.

## Input and Outputs

The command to input is ```Console.WriteLine();```.

However, the command to output or display is ```Console.ReadLine();```.

## Arithmetic Operator

Arithmetic operator are simple mathematic operation. The following table shows all the arithmetic operator -

| Operator   | Description | Example |
| --------   | ----------- | ------- |
| ```+```    | Adds two operand | A + B = 30| 
| ```-```    | Substract second operand from the list | A - B = 10 |
| ```*```    | Mutiples both operands | A * B = 200 |
| ```/```    | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B/A = 2 |
| ```% ```   |  Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B/A=2 |
| ```++```   | Increment oprator increases integer value by one | A ++= 11 |
| ```--```   | Decrement operator decreases integer value by one | A --= 9 |

## Relational Operators 

Relational operator are operator that defines a replation between two entities.

| Operator   | Description | Example |
| --------   | ----------- | ------- |
| ```==```   | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.| (A == B) is not true |
| ```!=```   | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (A!=B) is true. |
| ``` > ```  | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A>B) is not true |
| ``` < ```  | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true. |
| ``` >= ``` | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. |
| ``` <= ``` | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true. |

## Logical Operator

Logical operator are operator that connect two or more expression.

| Operator   | Description | Example |
| --------   | ----------- | ------- |
| &&         | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true. | (A && B) is false. |
| ||         | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true. | (A || B) is true. |
| !          | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false. | !(A && B) is true. |

## Assign Operator

The assignment Operator is the operator used to assign a new value to a variable.

| Operator   | Description | Example |
| --------   | ----------- | ------- |
| ``` = ```  | Simple assignment operator, assigns value from right side operands to left side operand | X = A |
| ``` += ``` | Add AND assignment operator, it adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand | X += A is the same as X = A + X |
| ``` -= ``` | Substract AND assignment operator, it subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to the left operand | X -= A |
| ``` *= ``` | Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand | C *= A |
| ``` /= ``` | Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand | 	C /= A
| ``` %= ``` | Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand | C %= A |

## Concatenation

Concatenation is the process of appending one string to the end of another string. You concatenate strings by using the ```+``` operator.

``` cs
using System;

namespace Program {

    class Program {
    
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!" + "Welcome to...");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Words

- Relational Operator 

- Logical Operator 

- Operand - is a value 

- Assign 

- Variable - is a "storage" that contains the information

- Datatype - allocates a specific memory

- Concatenation 

- Expression - is a mathematical logic that return a value. For example, A + B = X

- Decision 

- Statements 

- Algorihm - is a set of instruction

- Maths Function -

    - Ceiling 
    
    - Floor 

    - Math.Abs, etc..

- Control Structure - is used to specify the flow of the program: iteraion, sequence and 

- Iteration - are loops: while loop, do while loop, for loop and for each loop. It needs to have a control variable.

- Control Variable -

- Block Statements - is a where instruction are inside the statements, usually condition

- Branch Statements  

- Sequence 

- Syntax - is the language rule

- Concatenation  

- Function - is a block of code that performs a specific task 
    > it will return a value

- Procedure - is a block of code that performs a specific task that does not return a value.

- Method - combines fuction and procedure together and is used for specific languages suc as c#

- Library - is a collection of prewritten code that performs specific
