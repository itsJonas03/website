## Methods

A function is a separate block of code that performs a specific job. It is used as it mke it easier to write, read 
and debug code.

They cn be reused within the same program or other application saving both time and money.

### Method/Function

A program is broken up into sections. 

Each section is called a **class**.

Each class will have some goal that needs to achieve.

A class is further broen down into sections called functions.

A function is a group of instruction that toghter perfoem a task that will help the class acieve the overall goal.

Every C# program has at least one class with a special method named **Main**.

The main method has a task to start the program running.

### Simple Method Structure

Public means all the program can see the mothod called Access Specifier.

Void means no value will be returned once the task is complete.

``` storeData ``` is the name or the identifier of the method. This could be anything.

The () brackets are used to pass data called arguments to soething called parameters. Parameters are a variation
of a variable that is used by the method to store data that has been passed to it

```cs
public void storeData ( PARAMETERS GO HERE){
    //Instruction go between the curly brackets
    disply();
}
```

### Function and Static

The first line of a function/method is called a signature. It gives the name of the method nd each parameter variable.

> It also specifies the datatype of each parameter and the return type of the data to be returned if being used.
