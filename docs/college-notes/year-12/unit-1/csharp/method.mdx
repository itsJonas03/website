### Method/Function/Procedure

A **function** is a group of instruction that toghter perfoem a task that will help the class acieve the overall goal, aslso it returns a value.

A **procedure** is a function that doesn't return a value.

A **method** can be either function or procedure or both

:::note
A program is broken up into sections. Each section is called a **class**. Each class will have some goal that needs to achieve.

A class is further broken down into sections called functions.

Every C# program has at least one class with a special method named **Main**. The main method has a task to start the program running.
:::

The first line of a function/method is called a **signature**. It gives the name of the method nd each parameter variable.

> It also specifies the datatype of each parameter and the return type of the data to be returned if being used.

### Simple Method Structure

```public``` means all the program can see the mothod called Access Specifier.

```void``` means no value will be returned once the task is complete.

``` storeData ``` is the name or the identifier of the method. This could be anything.

The ```()``` brackets are used to pass data called arguments to soething called parameters. Parameters are a variation
of a variable that is used by the method to store data that has been passed to it

The example below shows a signature for procedure as it uses void.

```cs
public void storeData ( PARAMETERS GO HERE){
    //Instruction go between the curly brackets
    disply();
}
```


### Method/Function Return Signature 

Sometimes a function will perform an action, such as a calculation and need to return the result back to the main body of the 
code.

To do this a ```return``` line is added to the function and the word ```void``` is replaced with the **datatype** if the value being returned

```cs
public int32 sumScores ( PARAMETERS GO HERE) {
    // Calculation...
    return totalResult;  
}
```

### Method/Procedure with arguments

The argument is data that is passed into the method. It is placed in the brackets into the parameters.

```cs
public void add (int nOne, int nTwo){
    int result;
    result = nOne + nTwo;
}
```

#### Examples

The example below shows a pseudocode of a procedure:

```js
BEGIN 

    PROCEDURE MAIN
        
        TRIGGER myCacl
    
    END PROCEDURE 

    PROCEDURE myCalc

        DECLARE numOne, numTwo, result
        
        TRY
            DISPLAY Input first number
            INPUT numOne
            SET input to numOne
            DISPLAY Input second number
            INPUT numTwo
            SET input to numTwo
            ADD numOne and numTWo in result
            DISPLAY result
        
        END TRY
        CATCH 
            
            DISPLAY enter a number 
        
        END CATCH

    END PROCEDURE
    
END
```
